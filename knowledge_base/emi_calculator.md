# EMI Calculation Logic
- **Formula**: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N-1]
- **Variables**:
    - P: Principal loan amount.
    - R: Monthly interest rate (Annual rate / 12 / 100).
    - N: Loan tenure in months.
- [cite_start]**Rule**: Always state that the calculation is an estimate and subject to processing fees[cite: 41, 45].
